# ‚ö°Ô∏è Summary ‚ö°Ô∏è

In this project, We'll be using the AWS Identity and Access Management ***(IAM)*** service to control who is ***(authenticated)*** (signed in) and ***(authorized)*** (has permissions) in your AWS account. 
We'll launch an EC2 instances, then control who has access to it by creating some ***(IAM policies)*** and ***(user groups)***.
